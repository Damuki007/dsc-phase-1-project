## Project Overview

This project uses exploratory data analysis descriptive statistics, ratings, and title data from iMDb as well as  movie-grossing Box Office Mojo and The Numbers to generate insights for  Microsoft company who would like to create a new studio.



### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

### Methods
Application of descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis, and various visualization techniques to make sense of data provided.

## Recommendations
- The gross numbers(domestic, foreign & total) as well as return on investment numbers indicate a market of movies that is on the rise, hence the decision to create a studio company is well supported by the data in this report.
- The studio should aim for output of upwards of 15 movie projects on an annual basis in order to stay competitive with the most dominant players in the market such as A24 Studios, Amazon Studios, Annapurna Studios, etc.
- Microsoft movie studio should take advantage of the current state of the market that is still recovering from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic to launch a competitive studio and ride the wave to success as return on investment from movies should return to pre-pandemic margins in the next few years.
- Microsoft should invest in making movies across all genres in order to attract a more diverse audience hence increasing the likelihood for higher gross values.
- Content created on this studio platform should have runtimes that average 90 - 100 minutes.

## Summary

Movies enjoy a special place in everyone's memories as both an adult and as a child, hence, as a product it is marketable across all ages. The data analyzed in this report has shown that they enjoy steady average return rates of upwards of 1.5x with ever increasing gross both locally and internationally. The product is however unique in that outliers are not uncommon and movies, depending on factors such as popularity, cultural influence, timing, hidden messages and other nuanced intangible factors; can result in a singular movie product generating supernormal profits of up to 1000x return on investment.
